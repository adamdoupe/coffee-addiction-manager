This is a super simple command-line application who's sole purpose is
to allow one to enjoy coffee without developing an addiction.

You run the command `can_i_have_coffee` and it will tell you yes or no.

Currently, you have a 50% chance of having coffee on any given day.

However, if you have coffee for three days in a row, you can't have
coffee today (to prevent a dependence).

Enjoy!
